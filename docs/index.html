<!-- The Guiding Principle -->
<section id="guiding-principle" aria-labelledby="guiding-principle" data-item="The Guiding Principle">
<h2>
<a href="#guiding-principle">The Guiding Principle</a>
</h2>
<p>There are two ways that I could write this article:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>As a recipe</li>
<li>As a guide</li>
</ol>
<p>If I wrote it as a recipe, I would give step-by-step instructions
that you could follow without thinking. At the end (and very quickly)
you would have a game that works and amazes your friends, but all you
would have learned would be <em>how to follow instructions</em>.</p>
<p>I’m not going to do that.</p>
<p>I choose to write this article as a guide. That means both “as
someone who has already travelled this path” and “as a description of
what you will see along the way, and what to look out for.” As a
result:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, I will lead you down a little side-path, to explore
something interesting</li>
<li>Sometimes, I will go in the wrong direction and there will be an
unexpected difficulty that you will need to deal with</li>
<li>Sometimes, I will ask you to make predictions about what you think
will happen next (and you may be wrong)</li>
<li>Sometimes, I will ask you to use an idea that you have just learnt
to solve a new problem on your own</li>
<li>Sometimes, I will ask a question but I won’t answer it immediately,
so that when you see the answer, you will feel a sense of
enlightenment.</li>
</ul>
<p>My hope is that, at the end, you will have understood all the details
of what you have done well enough to be able to explain to someone else
how to create this game, and how to fix mistakes. In other words, at the
end, you will have mastered these basic JavaScript techniques, and not
just used them.</p>
<p>Perhaps this can be your guiding principle: if you can teach others,
then it shows that you have really learnt something. Perhaps this is
what will truly amaze your friends.</p>

<h2>
<a href="#intro">Preview</a>
</h2>
<p>This guide is designed for JavaScript beginners. It will show you not
just how to write simple code, but also how to convert an idea into a
script, how to search online for ways to make progress, and how to think
like a game developer.</p>
<p>You’ll be writing in plain JavaScript, using NodeJS, running on your
desktop computer.</p>
<p>I’ll start by showing you a simulation of the game that you will
create - a simulation that will run here, in this page in your browser.
<strong>Your game will not do that.</strong> My simulation is just to
help you think about all the different pieces that you’ll need to create
and how you will need to make them interact.</p>
<h2 id="who-i-am-writing-this-for">Who I am writing this for</h2>
<p>At the school for web development where I work, students have seen
all the code used in this game after only the first 10 days. The
challenge for me was to create an activity for them that would impress
their friends and family after such a short learning period.</p>
<p>Perhaps you haven’t even begun learning JavaScript yet. That’s OK.
I’ll explain how to get started, and how to check, step-by-step, that
you are on the right path.</p>
