<!-- The Guiding Principle -->
<section id="guiding-principle" aria-labelledby="guiding-principle" data-item="The Guiding Principle">
<h2>
<a href="#guiding-principle">The Guiding Principle</a>
</h2>
<p>There are two ways that I could write this article:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>As a recipe</li>
<li>As a guide</li>
</ol>
<p>If I wrote it as a recipe, I would give step-by-step instructions
that you could follow without thinking. At the end (and very quickly)
you would have a game that works and amazes your friends, but all you
would have learned would be <em>how to follow instructions</em>.</p>
<p>I’m not going to do that.</p>
<p>Remember: theres’s 10 days’ worth of course material here for you to
work through. It’s worth making an effort.</p>
<p>I choose to write this article as a guide. That means both “as
someone who has already travelled this path” and “as a description of
what you will see along the way, and what to look out for.” As a
result:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, I will lead you down a little side-path, to explore
something interesting</li>
<li>Sometimes, I will go in the wrong direction and there will be an
unexpected difficulty that you will need to deal with</li>
<li>Sometimes, I will ask you to make predictions about what you think
will happen next (and you may be wrong)</li>
<li>Sometimes, I will ask you to use an idea that you have just learnt
to solve a new problem on your own</li>
<li>Sometimes, I will ask a question but I won’t answer it immediately,
so that when you see the answer, you will feel a sense of
enlightenment.</li>
</ul>
<p>My hope is that, at the end, you will have understood all the details
of what you have done well enough to be able to explain to someone else
how to create this game, and how to fix their mistakes. In other words,
at the end, I hope you will have <em>mastered</em> these basic
JavaScript techniques, and not just used them.</p>
<p>Perhaps this can be your guiding principle: if you can teach others,
then it shows that you have really learnt something. Perhaps this is
what will truly amaze your friends.</p>

<!-- What Needs to be Done -->

<h2>
<a href="#what-needs-to-be-done">What Needs To Be Done</a>
</h2>
<p>When you play the game, you get caught up in it. (At least, I hope
you do.) But in order to create such a game, you have to step back and
think, in detail, about what moving parts it needs, and how to make them
move. So here’s a list of some of the things that you may have noticed,
without realising it.</p>
<h2 id="things-that-the-game-can-do">Things that the game can do</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>The game uses text.</li>
<li>Some of the text is fixed.</li>
<li>Some of the text is dynamic. It changes a little depending on the
circumstances.</li>
<li>Some of the text sometimes disappears.</li>
<li>The game uses numbers.</li>
<li>The numbers can be random, like the initial length of the nail.</li>
<li>The game asks you to make choices, and it asks you to type a number
or a letter to represent your choice.</li>
<li>The game can make its own choices: what text to show next, what move
the computer should make,</li>
<li>The game seems to use subtraction, because the nail gets shorter
after each turn.</li>
<li>The game uses repetition. You play, the computer plays, you play
again, …</li>
<li>The game makes calculations, so that the computer can win.</li>
<li>The game knows when the game is over.</li>
<li>In another kind of repetition, the game can start over from the
begininning.</li>
</ol>
<details class="question" open>
<summary>
Yes, but <em>how</em>…?
</summary>
<p>You can turn each of the statements above into a question.
“<strong>How does</strong> the game use text?”, “<strong>How
does</strong> the game make its own choices?”, “<strong>How
does</strong> the game know that the game is over?”</p>
<p>If you already have some knowledge of JavaScript, read the list above
again, and see if you can imagine how to deal with each of these
items.</p>
<p>You can think of this guide as a thirteen-part TV serial. These are
the plot points that will keep you in suspense until the final episode,
when all is revealed.</p>

<p>First, you need to set up a Development Environment. You need:</p>

</details>
<h2 id="install-nvm-nodejs-and-npm">Install NVM, NodeJS and npm</h2>
<p>The most comfortable way to install an application that will run
JavaScript files on your computer is to install a program called Node
Version Manager, or NVM for short.</p>
<p>Here is an <a
href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/">excellent
article on freeCodeCamp</a> which explains how to do just that.</p>
<details class="trouble" open>
<summary>
Typing commands… where?
</summary>
<p>The article above asks you to type commands like <code>nvm -v</code>.
Perhaps you have a question:</p>
<p><strong>“<em>Where exactly</em> do I type these
commands?”</strong></p>
<p>The answer is: “In a Terminal window”.</p>
<p>And the answer to your next question is: “Install Microsoft Virtual
Studio Code first, as explained below, and VS Code (as it is called, for
short) will provide you with an integrated Terminal window.”</p>
<p>As for the answer to your question: <strong>“Why didn’t you tell me
this <em>before</em> you gave the link for installing
Node?”</strong></p>
<p>As you work your way through this guide, you’ll see that I have done
my best to help troubleshoot any problems that might arise. But if a
problem doesn’t arise for you, you don’t want to be bothered with Too
Much Information about what <em>might</em> have gone wrong.</p>
<p>In the future, if you run into difficulties, look a little ahead for
an bright orange band with a lifebuoy logo, like the one at the top of
this panel. Normally, it will be closed, because I hope that you do not
often have problems. Open it up to find troubleshooting suggestions.</p>

<p>NodeJS is not an application that you can open like a browser or
social media app. It does not have a desktop icon you can click on or a
Graphic User Interface (or GUI) where you can point and click with your
mouse. Instead, you have to control NodeJS from a Terminal.</p>
<p>The best place to find a Terminal is in VS Code. VS Code does have a
GUI.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-a-colour-scheme">Choosing a colour scheme</h2>
<p>When you first launch VS Code, it asks you to choose your what
colours to use for the GUI. As a developer, you are going to be looking
at your computer screen a lot, so it’s good to be able to choose colours
that you find clear and well-contrasted. Most developers choose a dark
background with light text, as this is easier on the eyes.</p>

<p>For now, perhaps you will be happy with the default colour scheme.
You can always make a different choice later. Click on the Welcome link

<p>A successful business has many employees, in many different offices

will be many different files, in many different folders on many
different computers…</p>
<h2 id="organizing-your-files">Organizing your files</h2>
<p>This project is simple. It will only use one file. But you should be
ready to grow big quickly, and plan accordingly. It’s therefore
important to structure your work properly.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>From the File menu in VS Code, choose <code>Open Folder</code></li>
<li>Use the dialog to create a new folder that will hold all your
projects that you create from tutorials, like this one. Save it in your
Documents folder, or in a place where you can quickly find it
again.</li>
<li>You could call it <code>My Learning Journey</code> or something like
that.</li>
<li>Inside this generic folder, create a folder specifically for this

<p>The first thing on the <a href="#what-needs-to-be-done">list of

something like this:</p>
<pre class="language-bash wrap"><code class="language-bash wrap">cd /path/to/downloaded/folder

<p>The completed game also remembers your score against the

<h2>
<a href="#what-is-the-console">What Is The Console?</a>
</h2>
<p>I can imagine a question in your mind: <strong>How does this code in
<code>main.js</code> …</strong></p>
<pre class="language-javascript line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript line-numbers">console.log("Hello World")</code></pre>
<p><strong>… plus this command in the Terminal…</strong></p>
<pre class="language-bash wrap"><code class="language-bash wrap">node main.js</code></pre>
<p><strong>… make this text appear in the Terminal?</strong></p>
<pre class="language-tex wrap"><code class="language-tex wrap">Hello World!</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-console-and-console.log">The console and
<code>console.log()</code></h2>
<p>In NodeJS, “<a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console">console</a>”
is how JavaScript refers to the Terminal where the current script is
running. (Later, you’ll see that browsers also have a Console, which
behaves very like the Terminal.)</p>
<h2 id="objects-and-methods">Objects and methods</h2>
<p><code>console</code> is a <em>global object</em>. This means that you
can use it anywhere (globally), and that it can have
<code>methods</code> and <code>properties</code>. As you will see,
JavaScript is built with objects.</p>
<p>A method is something an object can do. A property is something it
has. It doesn’t have to have any methods or properties. If you think of
a method like a human being:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be like a new-born baby, who can cry but has no possessions
yet. (It has methods but no properties)</li>
<li>It can be like a reclusive miser, who has many possessions but does
nothing with them. (It has properties, but no methods)</li>
<li>It can be like a regular person, who has stuff and does stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>console</code> has several methods but no properties. (It’s
like a house elf. It doesn’t need any possessions.)</p>
<p>In this project, you will use the following methods:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>method</th>
<th>action</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>console.log()</code></td>
<td>prints the parameters in the Terminal</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>console.clear()</code></td>
<td>removes all text from the Terminal</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="parameters">Parameters</h2>
<p>The data inside the round parentheses (<code>( ... )</code>) is
called a <em>parameter</em>. In this case <code>"Hello World!"</code> is
the only parameter.</p>
<details class="pivot" open>
<summary>
Showing text in the Terminal
</summary>
<p>You’ll be using <code>console.log()</code> several times in your
project, to show text in the Terminal.</p>
<p>As you’ll discover, it can also be used to <em>hide</em> text, but
not many people know this. (You don’t have to keep it a secret.)</p>

<p>The game that you are about to create shows several lines of text,
right at the beginning:</p>
<pre class="language-tex wrap"><code class="language-tex wrap">Let's knock a nail into this computer!

* Each player takes a turn to hit the nail once.
* A player can use one of three levels of strength: gently, firmly, hard.
* Depending on the strength used, the nail will be driven more or less deeply into the Terminal.
* The player who knocks the nail all the way in is the winner.

Are you ready?</code></pre>
<p>You might have noticed that the text in <code>"Hello World!"</code>
was surrounded by <em>double-quote</em> characters (<code>"</code>). You
might think that all you need to do is paste the multiline text that you
want to show inside double-quotes. But if you do, VS Code shows you lots
of wavy red lines, and tells you that you have 52 problems, on for each
word that is not in the first line.</p>

<h2 id="using-backticks">Using backticks</h2>
<p>If you want to create a block of text with more than one line, in
JavaScript, you need to use backticks (<code>`</code>).</p>
<p>Backticks can make you feel like a real programmer, if only because
you’ve probably never used them before. And also, because you might have
to spend some time looking at your keyboard to find where the backtick
key is hiding.</p>
<p>Every keyboard manufacturer has their own idea of <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=backtick+keyboard&amp;udm=2">where
to hide the backtick character on your keyboard</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fix-your-code">Fix your code</h2>
<p>When you have found the backtick key:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In <code>main.js</code>, replace the double-quote characters with
single backticks, one at the beginning, and one at the end of the
text.</li>
<li>In the Terminal, run:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="language-bash wrap"><code class="language-bash wrap">node main.js</code></pre>
<p>You should see your multiline block of text appear, as shown in
Figure 7 below.</p>

All about backticks and template literals
</summary>
<p>Backticks are very powerful. They can be used to do much more than
just contain multiple lines of text. You won’t need to use any of their
other powers in this project, but it’s good to know that they can help
in many ways.</p>

Multiple Cursors

<p>If you look carefully at Figure 7, or less carefully at the images

one just after each backtick.</p>

<p>When you installed NodeJS, a program called <code>npm</code> was
installed at the same time. You can use this program to fetch NodeJS
packages from the <code>npmjs.com</code> website, and include them in
your project. Here’s how you can do this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make sure your computer is connected to the Internet</li>
<li>In the Terminal for your <code>Nail_It</code> directory, run:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="language-bash wrap"><code class="language-bash wrap">npm install readline-sync</code></pre>
<details class="tip" open>
<summary>
npm i
</summary>
<p>Like me, and most programmers, you can be lazy. You can use
<code>i</code> as a shortcut for <code>install</code>.</p>
<p>This command will have exactly the same effect:</p>
<pre class="language-bash wrap"><code class="language-bash wrap">npm i readline-sync</code></pre>
</details>
<figure>
<img src="images/installReadlineSync.webp"
alt="Installing readline-sync" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Installing readline-sync</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You’ll see several things happen:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There will be a burst of activity in your Terminal as
<code>npm</code> requests and then receives the files that you
need.</li>
<li>A folder called <code>node_modules</code> will be created in your
<code>Nail_It</code> folder</li>
<li>Two new files will be added to your <code>Nail_It</code> folder:
<ul>
<li><code>package.json</code></li>
<li><code>package-lock.json</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="package.json"><code>package.json</code></h2>
<p>The contents of <code>package.json</code> should look something like
this (the version number may be different):</p>
<pre class="language-json line-numbers"><code class="language-json line-numbers">{
  "dependencies": {
    "readline-sync": "^1.4.10"
  }
}</code></pre>
<details class="tldr">
<summary>
JSON and package.json
</summary>
<p><code>JSON</code> stands for “JavaScript Object Notation”. A
<code>.json</code> file can be used to store hierarchical information.
It has a very strict file structure. If there is a comma too few or a
comma too many in <code>package.json</code>, <code>npm</code> won’t be
able to read it. If you use backticks or single-quotes (<code>'</code>)
instead of double-quotes, <code>npm</code> won’t be able to read it.
Treat <code>package.json</code> nicely.</p>
<p>The file <code>package.json</code> contains information that ensures
that your project will work even if it is copied to someone else’s
computer. In this particular case, it says: “This project needs the
<code>readline-sync</code> Node package, and it was built using
version”1.4.10”, so it should work with that version or a more recent
one.”</p>
<p>Some Node packages require other Node packages in order to work
correctly. The <code>package-lock.json</code> file contains details of
every package that was installed, and every package that <em>each of
those packages</em> installed. If you send a copy of your project to a
colleague, the <code>package-lock.json</code> file will ensure that your
colleague is working with exactly the same Node packages as you. This
eliminates many cases where “It works on my computer!” is an issue.</p>

<h2 id="using-readline-sync">Using readline-sync</h2>

alt="Sign showning a house number and the house’s name" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Sign showning a house number and the
house’s name</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When you write JavaScript, you talk about <em>variables</em>, not
houses, and the space defined by each address is actually a block of
Random Access Memory (RAM). However, the principle is the same. You, the
human, create a name for a block of memory, and the NodeJS associates
that name with a number in its index of available blocks, so it knows
which memory block you are talking about.</p>
<p>In my metaphor, you <em>put</em> an <em>agent, or just some
stuff</em>, in each named <em>house</em>, then the agents work together
with the stuff that you have given them to build a display on the street
(the end-user’s screen) that the end-user can interact with.</p>
<p>In the world of JavaScript, your code <em>assigns</em> a
<em>value</em> to each named <em>variable</em>. When you use a variable
name later, JavaScript looks up the number of the memory block in its
index, and uses the <em>contents</em> of the block instead of its
<em>name</em>.</p>
<h2 id="const-vs-let"><code>const</code> vs <code>let</code></h2>
<p><code>const</code> and <code>let</code> are two ways of telling
JavaScript to create a named space in its RAM.</p>
<p><code>const</code> tells JavaScript: “Here is some data, it will be
<em>constant</em>, it will never change.” As a result, JavaScript can
optimize the space for the data. This is like when you buy a house. You
become the permanent owner, and once the initial paperwork is done,
everything is simple. You live there: that’s it.</p>
<p>Because the value in a variable created <code>const</code> has a
fixed value, you must give a value as soon as you declare the
variable.</p>
<p><code>let</code> tells NodeJS: “You know, I need some space, but I
can’t be sure how much or what I’ll use it for, and I might change my
mind. Can you create a space that can get bigger or smaller and that can
hold text or a number or an object with many functions… or just about
anything?”</p>
<p>When you use <code>let</code>, JavaScript has to be prepared for
changes. This is like when you let out your house. You don’t know what
the new tenants are going to do to it, so you need to make an inventory,
prepare a lease, ask for a deposit, … all sort of extra things. And this
has to be renewed each time the tenant changes.</p>
<p>Because the value in a variable created <code>let</code> can change,
you can declare the variable without giving it a value. This is
perfectly good code:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">let variableWithNoInitialValue</code></pre>
<p>This will cause an error:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">const constantsMustBeAssignedAValue</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="images/missingInitializer.webp"
alt="You must give a const variable a value when you create it" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">You must give a <code>const</code>
variable a value when you create it</figcaption>
</figure>
<details class="tip" open>
<summary>
Use <code>const</code> when possible
</summary>
<p>Your code will work faster (and your end-users will be happier) if
you declare your variables <code>const</code> every time you can.</p>
</details>
<h2 id="variable-names">Variable names</h2>
<p>I’ve used the variable names <code>readlineSync</code>,
<code>whoStarts</code> and <code>player</code>. The name of the Node
Package that you installed was <code>readline-sync</code>. Why didn’t I
use <code>readline-sync</code> for the name of the variable?</p>
<p>Computing is all about speed. If JavaScript allowed me to use any
name, then it would have to spend more time looking at each name to be
sure that it was a name and not some other kind of data. So JavaScript
has rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>A variable name can begin with a letter, a dollar sign
(<code>$</code>) or an underscore (<code>_</code>)</li>
<li>A variable name can contain letters, dollar signs, underscores and
numbers (but it can’t start with a number)</li>
<li>A variable name <em>cannot</em> contain a space (<code></code>) or a
dash (<code>-</code>) (so <code>readline-sync</code> is not
possible)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="variable-naming-conventions">Variable naming conventions</h3>
<p>By convention, when a variable is created from more than one word
(like <code>whoStarts</code>), the first letter in each word is written
in uppercase letters. This is called <em>camelCase</em>.</p>
<details class="tldr">
<summary>
Other variable formats
</summary>
<p>In HTML and CSS, you will use <em>kebab-case</em> for <code>id</code>
and <code>class</code> names.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, you might also find some constants written in
<em>SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE</em> (but not in this project). These will be
global constants that are set when the program first starts, and which
can be used in many different places.</p>
<p>NodeJS also provides some special variables, like
<code>__dirname</code> and <code>__filename</code>, which start with a
double underscore. Again, you won’t see these in this project.</p>
<p>There are many different formats that can be used for variable names.
The most comprehensive list I’ve found is <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/64293621/1927589">here</a>.</p>
</details>
<h2 id="equals-signs">Equals signs</h2>
<p>In JavaScript, a single equals sign (<code>=</code>) is used to
assign a value to a variable (or to use the house metaphor, to tell
JavaScript to move a given piece of data into a named address). So…</p>
<pre class="language-bash wrap"><code class="language-bash wrap">const whoStarts = "If you want to start..."</code></pre>
<p>… tells JavaScript:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select a block of memory at an address that I will call
<code>whoStarts</code>.</li>
<li>The contents of this memory block are not going to change. They will
be constant.</li>
<li>Assign the text “If you want to start…” to this memory block.</li>
<li>In the future, when I refer to <code>whoStarts</code>, use the
contents of the memory block instead.</li>
</ul>
<details class="note" open>
<summary>
===
</summary>
<p>As you will see shortly, three equals signs together
(<code>===</code>) means “is identical to”. This creates an expression
which can be either true or false. For example: <code>2 + 2 === 4</code>
is <code>true</code>, but <code>2 + 2 === "four"</code> is
<code>false</code>. But more about this later.</p>

<!-- require and modules -->
<section id="require-and-modules" aria-labelledby="require-and-modules" data-item="require() and Modules">
<h2>
<a href="#require-and-modules"><code>require()</code> and Modules</a>
</h2>
<p>Here’s an edited version of the first few lines of code:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript line-numbers">const readlineSync = require("readline-sync")
const whoStarts = "If you want to start, type Y..." // shortened</code></pre>
<pre class="skip"><code class="skip">// lines skipped //</code></pre>
<pre class="language-js line-numbers" data-start="14"><code class="language-js line-numbers">let player = readlineSync.keyInYN(whoStarts)
console.log("player:", player)</code></pre>
<p>You’ve seen that <code>readlineSync</code> somehow allows you to type
a letter in the Terminal, and then JavaScript knows if that letter was a
<code>Y</code> or not. But where does <code>readlineSync</code> get all
this power from? And how could you have guessed to use
<code>.keyInYN()</code> to make this happen?</p>
<h2 id="require---a-global-function"><code>require()</code> - a global
function</h2>
<p>The function <code>require()</code> is a native part of JavaScript.
You can use it anywhere. It expects the name the parameter to be
either…</p>
<ul>
<li>The name of a module</li>
</ul>
<p>… or:</p>
<ul>
<li>The path to a file which contains a module script.</li>
</ul>
<p>It then loads the module script that it finds at the designated
place, and makes it available to your script.</p>
<h2 id="finding-readline-sync">Finding <code>readline-sync</code></h2>
<p>When NodeJS reads <code>require("readline-sync")</code>, it
understands that <code>"readline-sync"</code> is not the path to a file,
so it looks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inside the <code>node_modules</code> folder for a folder with the
same name</li>
<li>Inside that folder for a <code>package.json</code> file</li>
<li>Inside the <code>package.json</code> file for an entry for
“main”</li>
<li>For the file named by “main”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s what it finds:</p>
<pre class="language-json line-numbers" data-start="21"><code class="language-json line-numbers">  "main": "./lib/readline-sync.js",</code></pre>

<p>JavaScript now reads all the code that it finds in the file at
<code>node_modules/readline-sync/lib/readline-sync.js</code>, and
executes it.</p>
<details class="tldr" open>
<summary>
TL;DR
</summary>
<p><strong>Don’t worry. I don’t expect the code below to mean anything
to you. I’m just showing you that all the code in a Node Module package
is openly available. There’s no hidden magic.</strong></p>
<p>The code in <code>readline-sync.js</code> includes the following
(minor edit for clarity):</p>
<pre class="language-javascript line-numbers" data-start="1220"><code class="language-javascript line-numbers"><i>function _keyInYN(query, options, limit) {
  var res;
  if (query == null) { query = 'Are you sure? '; }
  if ((!options || options.guide !== false) && (query += '')) {
    query = query.replace(/\s*:?\s*$/, '') + ' [y/n]: ';
  }
  /* eslint-disable key-spacing */
  res = exports.keyIn(query, margeOptions(options, {
    // -------- forced
    hideEchoBack:       false,
    limit:              limit,
    trueValue:          'y',
    falseValue:         'n',
    caseSensitive:      false
    // mask doesn't work.
  }));
  // added:     guide
  /* eslint-enable key-spacing */
  return typeof res === 'boolean' ? res : '';
}</i>
<b>exports.keyInYN = function(query, options) {
  return _keyInYN(query, options);
};</b></code></pre>
<p>There, on line 1240 in
<code>node_modules/readline-sync/lib/readline-sync.js</code>, is the
function <code>keyInYN</code>, which your JavaScript can now use, thanks
to the <code>require()</code> function.</p>
</details>
<h2 id="a-black-box">A black box</h2>
<p>You can consider the contents of <code>node_modules</code> to be a
black box. You don’t need to understand how it works, just like you
don’t need to understand how your phone works. All you need to know is
that, if you give the right input, you will get the output that you
need.</p>
<p>I’ve just shown you how to look inside this black box, so that you
can see the sort of content that it contains, but you may never need to
do this again. It’s enough to know that it works.</p>

which has key-value pairs. Here’s another object to illustrate this:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">{ key: "value", anotherKey: "another value", "a third key": 3 }</code></pre>
<p>There are rules about how the names of the keys can be formed. They
are similar to the rules for variable names. However, you can create a
key name with any character in it, if you enclosed the key name with
quotation marks.</p>

<li>Repeat steps 3 - 5 again, but press a completely different key.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you press <code>Y</code>, you should see

<summary>
Yes, No or …?
</summary>
<p>Here’s a challenge.</p>
<p>Can you rewrite the code so that it shows exactly the value that the
<code>keyInYN()</code> method returns, instead of a text like
‘Installing now…’ or ‘Searching for another…’?</p>
<p>It should show <code>true</code> if <code>Y</code> is pressed,
<code>false</code> if <code>N</code> is pressed or nothing if another
key is pressed.</p>
<p>Hint: the file you created at <code>Nail_It/main.js</code> already
does this. You can copy ideas from there.</p>

<pre class="language-javascript line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript line-numbers">const readlineSync = require("readline-sync");
const question = "Do you want this module?"
const yesOrNo = readlineSync.keyInYN(question) 
console.log("yesOrNo: *", yesOrNo, "*")</code></pre>
<p>I’ve added asterisk (<code>*</code>) characters around the value of
<code>yesOrNo</code>, so that you can see when <code>yesOrNo</code>
contains neither <code>true</code> nor <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>Note that there will be a space added between each item that
<code>console.log()</code> prints, so when <code>yesOrNo</code> contains
an empty string, <code>console.log()</code> prints <code>*  *</code>,
with two spaces between the asterisks.</p>

<p>Search the documentation for more places where it talks about
<code>keyInYN</code>, until you find this:</p>

</blockquote>
<details class="question" open>
<summary>
Optional parameters
</summary>
<p>The square brackets in <code>keyInYN([query[, options]])</code> mean
“The data inside these square brackets is optional.” This means that
<code>readlineSync.keyInYN()</code> (with no parameters at all) should
work.</p>
<p>Why don’t you try it?<br />
What does it do?<br />
Where in the documentation can you find a description of what to
expect?</p>
</details>
<p>And later, you should find this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… the following additional option is available.<br />
<strong>guide</strong></p>
<p><em>Type</em>: boolean<br />
<em>Default</em>: true</p>
<p>If true is specified, a string ‘[y/n]’ as guide for the user is added
to query.</p>

<p>Can you create an options object like <code>{ guide: false }</code>
and add it as the second parameter of the <code>keyInYN()</code> method?
What do you expect will happen if you do?</p>

<section id="true-and-false" aria-labelledby="true-and-false" data-item="A Few Words about True And False">
<h2>
<a href="#true-and-false">A Few Words about True And False</a>
</h2>
<p>You’ve seen the keywords <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> a
few times now.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, these two special values, <code>true</code> and
<code>false</code>, are not words or numbers or objects: they are
<em>boolean</em>.</p>
<p>Boolean Logic is a branch of mathematics that deals with whether
things are true or false. It is named after <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole">George Boole</a>, who
invented this branch.</p>
<p>For example, the expression <em>“The human player pressed the
<code>Y</code> key”</em> can be either <code>true</code> (Yes, the
player pressed the <code>Y</code> key) or <code>false</code> (The player
hasn’t pressed any key yet, or the key the player pressed was not
<code>Y</code>).</p>
<h2 id="if-else"><code>if</code> … <code>else</code> …</h2>
<p>You’ve also seen code in the <a
href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/readline-sync">documentation for the
<code>readline-sync</code> package</a> with a statement using
<code>if ... else ...</code>:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><b>if</b> <i>(readlineSync.keyInYN('Do you want this module?')) </i><b>{</b><i>
  // 'Y' key was pressed.
  console.log('Installing now...');
  // Do something...</i>
<b>} else {</b><i>
  // Another key was pressed.
  console.log('Searching for another...');
  // Do something...</i>
<b>}</b></code></pre>
<p>Your Nail It! game needs to make decisions about what to do next. So
far, you have got it to ask the user if they want to start. Your
<code>main.js</code> script has a variable called <code>player</code>,
whose value may be <code>true</code> (if the human player pressed the
<code>Y</code> key), or something that is not <code>true</code>. So it
knows whether the human player chose to go first or not.</p>
<p>If the player chose to play first, your script needs to ask how hard
they want to hit the nail. If the user chose not to play first, then the
script must decide how hard the AI should hit the nail.</p>
<p>To get your game to make such a decision, you can use a statement
with two branches, like the one above. In your case, it will be more
like:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript line-numbers">if (player) { // it's the human player's turn
  // TODO: ask the human player for a number between 1 and 3
} else { // it's the AI's turn to play
  // TODO: choose the number between 1 and 3 to ensure AI wins
  // (if possible)
}</code></pre>
<details class="note" open>
<summary>
Comments
</summary>
<p>Not everything in a JavaScript file is active code. You can add
<em>comments</em>, like those shown above, by putting a double slash
(<code>//</code>) to the left of any text that is not code. The
JavaScript engine will ignore anything from that point until the end of
the line.</p>
<p>You can also put <code>/*</code> before a comment section and
<code>*/</code> after it. You can do this in the middle of a line or to
span many lines.</p>
<p>In the code above, the comments indicate what code still has to be
written. In other cases, you can use comments to explain what the code
does. This is especially important if the logic is complex.</p>
</details>
<h2 id="truthy-and-falsy">Truthy and falsy</h2>
<p>In the last section, you saw that the value generated by ’keyInYN()`
can be:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>true</code> if the user presses the <code>Y</code> key</li>
<li><code>false</code> if the user presses the <code>N</code> key</li>
<li>“” (an empty string) if the user presses any other key</li>
</ul>
<p>JavaScript has an … interesting way of considering whether something
is <code>true</code> or not. You can read more about this in the article
for <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy">Truthy</a>
on the MDN web site.</p>
<p>In short, JavaScript treats the number <code>0</code>, the empty
string <code>""</code> and a few other empty values as
<code>false</code>. These values are said to be <em>falsy</em>.</p>
<p>Conversely, JavaScript treats anything that is not <code>false</code>
or <code>0</code> or empty as <code>true</code>… even the word
<code>"false"</code>, because <code>"false"</code> contains letters, so
it’s not empty. Anything that is not <code>false</code> or falsy is
<em>truthy</em>.</p>
<p>Later in this project, you’ll see a trick to convert
<code>true</code> to <code>1</code> and <code>false</code> to
<code>0</code>.</p>

Playing with <code>node</code> in the Terminal
</summary>
<p>For testing, you can run an Interactive Development Environment (IDE)
for Node in a Terminal.</p>
<p>Open a new Terminal, and try this:</p>
<pre class="language-tex wrap"><code class="language-tex wrap"><b>node</b>
Welcome to Node.js v23.1.0.
Type ".help" for more information.
&gt; <b>if (true) console.log("This", /* "but not this", */ "and that")</b>
This and that
<i>undefined</i>
&gt; <b>if (false) console.log("Nothing will be printed")</b>
<i>undefined</i>
&gt; <b>if ("false") console.log("The word 'false' is truthy")</b>
The word 'false' is truthy
<i>undefined</i>
&gt; <b>if (0) console.log("Zero is falsy")</b>
<i>undefined</i></code></pre>
<p>When an expression is <code>false</code> or falsy, an <code>if</code>
statement will ignore any instructions associated with it.</p>
<p>The <code>undefined</code> text simply means that
<code>console.log()</code> did not generate a value. When you call
<code>readlineSync.keyInYN()</code>, it generates a value, but
<code>console.log()</code> just logs data quietly to the console.</p>

<p>The third example in <a
href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/readline-sync">documentation for the
<code>readline-sync</code> package</a>, is something like the code that
follows.</p>
<details class="note" open>
<summary>
Edited for clarity
</summary>
<p>I’ve edited a bit for clarity. In particular, the first line selects
<code>keyInSelect</code> directly from the <code>readline-sync</code>
code, using a technique known as <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment">destructuring
assignment</a>.</p>
</details>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Let the user choose an item from a list:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="language-javascript line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript line-numbers">const { keyInSelect } = require('readline-sync')
const animals = [
  'Lion',
  'Elephant',
  'Crocodile',
  'Giraffe',
  'Hippo'
]
const question = 'Which animal?'
const index = keyInSelect(animals, question);
console.log(
  'Ok, ' + animals[index] + ' goes to your room.'
); </code></pre>
<p>[1] Lion<br />
[2] Elephant<br />
[3] Crocodile<br />
[4] Giraffe<br />
[5] Hippo<br />
[0] CANCEL</p>
<p>Which animal? [1…5 / 0]: 2<br />
Ok, Elephant goes to your room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To test this example:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Using your Terminal, create a new file:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="language-bash wrap"><code class="language-bash wrap">code keyInSelect.js</code></pre>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Paste the four lines of code above into your new script file.</li>
<li>In the Terminal, run:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="language-bash wrap"><code class="language-bash wrap">node keyInSelect.js</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="images/keyInSelect.webp"
alt="Testing keyInSelect() in a new script" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Testing keyInSelect() in a new

</figure>
<p>It works exactly as advertised. But for your game, you want a number,
not an animal. You are going to have to change this code, and see
exactly what is going on inside it.</p>
<details class="sandbox" open>
<summary>
Adapting for the Nail It! game
</summary>
<p>You can edit the code in your new <code>keyInSelect.js</code> file so
that it asks the question that you will need for the Nail It! game:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript line-numbers"><i>const { keyInSelect } = require('readline-sync')
const </i><b>strength</b><i> = [
  </i><b>'gently',
  'firmly',
  'hard'</b><i>
]
const question = '</i><b>How hard do you plan to hit?</b><i>'
const index = keyInSelect(</i><b>strength</b><i>, question);
console.log(</i>
  <b>"index:", index</b>
<i>)</i></code></pre>
<p>Notice that instead of using <code>console.log()</code> to show the
name of the item that is chosen, the code above logs the value of the
<code>index</code> returned by <code>keyInSelect()</code>, directly. The
result may surprise you.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/howHard.webp"
alt="The value of index is 1 less than the number you press" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The value of <code>index</code> is 1 less
than the number you press</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can try it several times. The value of <code>index</code> that is
logged will always be 1 less than the number you press.</p>
<pre class="language-tex"><code class="language-tex"><i>How hard do you plan to hit? [1, 2, 3, 0]: </i><b>0</b><i>
index: </i><b>-1</b><i>

How hard do you plan to hit? [1, 2, 3, 0]: </i><b>1</b><i>
index: </i><b>0</b><i>

How hard do you plan to hit? [1, 2, 3, 0]: </i><b>2</b><i>
index: </i><b>1</b><i>

How hard do you plan to hit? [1, 2, 3, 0]: </i><b>3</b><i>
index: </i><b>2</b><i></i></code></pre>
Is this a bug or a feature?
