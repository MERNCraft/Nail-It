<!-- The Guiding Principle -->
<section id="guiding-principle" aria-labelledby="guiding-principle" data-item="The Guiding Principle">
<h2>
<a href="#guiding-principle">The Guiding Principle</a>
</h2>
<p>There are two ways that I could write this article:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>As a recipe</li>
<li>As a guide</li>
</ol>
<p>If I wrote it as a recipe, I would give step-by-step instructions
that you could follow without thinking. At the end (and very quickly)
you would have a game that works and amazes your friends, but all you
would have learned would be <em>how to follow instructions</em>.</p>
<p>I’m not going to do that.</p>
<p>Remember: theres’s 10 days’ worth of course material here for you to
work through. It’s worth making an effort.</p>
<p>I choose to write this article as a guide. That means both “as
someone who has already travelled this path” and “as a description of
what you will see along the way, and what to look out for.” As a
result:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, I will lead you down a little side-path, to explore
something interesting</li>
<li>Sometimes, I will go in the wrong direction and there will be an
unexpected difficulty that you will need to deal with</li>
<li>Sometimes, I will ask you to make predictions about what you think
will happen next (and you may be wrong)</li>
<li>Sometimes, I will ask you to use an idea that you have just learnt
to solve a new problem on your own</li>
<li>Sometimes, I will ask a question but I won’t answer it immediately,
so that when you see the answer, you will feel a sense of
enlightenment.</li>
</ul>
<p>My hope is that, at the end, you will have understood all the details
of what you have done well enough to be able to explain to someone else
how to create this game, and how to fix their mistakes. In other words,
at the end, I hope you will have <em>mastered</em> these basic
JavaScript techniques, and not just used them.</p>
<p>Perhaps this can be your guiding principle: if you can teach others,
then it shows that you have really learnt something. Perhaps this is
what will truly amaze your friends.</p>

<!-- What Needs to be Done -->

<h2>
<a href="#what-needs-to-be-done">What Needs To Be Done</a>
</h2>
<p>When you play the game, you get caught up in it. (At least, I hope
you do.) But in order to create such a game, you have to step back and
think, in detail, about what moving parts it needs, and how to make them
move. So here’s a list of some of the things that you may have noticed,
without realising it.</p>
<h2 id="things-that-the-game-can-do">Things that the game can do</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>The game uses text.</li>
<li>Some of the text is fixed.</li>
<li>Some of the text is dynamic. It changes a little depending on the
circumstances.</li>
<li>Some of the text sometimes disappears.</li>
<li>The game uses numbers.</li>
<li>The numbers can be random, like the initial length of the nail.</li>
<li>The game asks you to make choices, and it asks you to type a number
or a letter to represent your choice.</li>
<li>The game can make its own choices: what text to show next, what move
the computer should make,</li>
<li>The game seems to use subtraction, because the nail gets shorter
after each turn.</li>
<li>The game uses repetition. You play, the computer plays, you play
again, …</li>
<li>The game makes calculations, so that the computer can win.</li>
<li>The game knows when the game is over.</li>
<li>In another kind of repetition, the game can start over from the
begininning.</li>
</ol>
<details class="question" open>
<summary>
Yes, but <em>how</em>…?
</summary>
<p>You can turn each of the statements above into a question.
“<strong>How does</strong> the game use text?”, “<strong>How
does</strong> the game make its own choices?”, “<strong>How
does</strong> the game know that the game is over?”</p>
<p>If you already have some knowledge of JavaScript, read the list above
again, and see if you can imagine how to deal with each of these
items.</p>
<p>You can think of this guide as a thirteen-part TV serial. These are
the plot points that will keep you in suspense until the final episode,
when all is revealed.</p>

<h2>
<a href="#setting-up-your-development-environment">Setting Up Your
Development Environment</a>
</h2>
<p>First, you need to set up a Development Environment. You need:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A way to run JavaScript or NodeJS scripts on your computer</li>
<li>A code editor which will give you plenty of tools for writing
JavaScript.</li>
</ol>

You may already be ahead of me

<p>If you already have Node and VS Code installed, you can skip this
section</p>
</details>
<h2 id="install-nvm-nodejs-and-npm">Install NVM, NodeJS and npm</h2>
<p>The most comfortable way to install an application that will run
JavaScript files on your computer is to install a program called Node
Version Manager, or NVM for short.</p>
<p>Here is an <a
href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/">excellent
article on freeCodeCamp</a> which explains how to do just that.</p>
<details class="trouble" open>
<summary>
Typing commands… where?
</summary>
<p>The article above asks you to type commands like <code>nvm -v</code>.
Perhaps you have a question:</p>
<p><strong>“<em>Where exactly</em> do I type these
commands?”</strong></p>
<p>The answer is: “In a Terminal window”.</p>
<p>And the answer to your next question is: “Install Microsoft Virtual
Studio Code first, as explained below, and VS Code (as it is called, for
short) will provide you with a Terminal window.”</p>
<p>As for the answer to your question: <strong>“Why didn’t you tell me
this <em>before</em> you gave the link for installing
Node?”</strong></p>
<p>As you work your way through this guide, you’ll see that I have done
my best to help troubleshoot any problems that might arise. But if a
problem doesn’t arise for you, you don’t want to be bothered with Too
Much Information about what <em>might</em> have gone wrong.</p>
<p>In the future, if you run into difficulties, look a little ahead for
an bright orange band with a lifebuoy logo, like the one at the top of
this panel. Normally, it will be closed, because I hope that you do not
often have problems. That’s where you should find troubleshooting
suggestions.</p>

Let me know if anything is unclear…

<p>If you find that you are blocked and none of the suggestions I give
help you to make any progress, <a
href="https://github.com/MERNCraft/Nail-it/issues/new">create an
issue</a> for me, and I will deal with it as soon as I can.</p>
</details>
<h2 id="install-microsoft-virtual-studio-code">Install Microsoft Virtual
Studio Code</h2>
<p>Virtual Studio Code (or VS Code, for short) is a free code editor
with many powerful tools that are either built-in or are availble as
free extensions.</p>
<p>You can follow the <a
href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">instructions to install VS
Code for your operating system</a>, and enjoy all the hard work that
other developers have contributed to make your experience of writing
code so easy.</p>
<details class="tip" open>
<summary>
A Terminal for installing Node?
</summary>
<p>If you need a Terminal for <a
href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/">installing
Node</a>, you can use <a
href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics">VS Code’s
integrated Terminal</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, the game you are going to create will be run from VS Code’s
integrated Terminal, so you will be spending a lot of time working with
it.</p>

<p>This guide is designed for JavaScript beginners. It will show you not
just how to write simple code, but also how to convert an idea into a
script, how to search online for ways to make progress, and how to think
like a game developer.</p>
<p>You’ll be writing in plain JavaScript, using NodeJS, running on your
desktop computer.</p>
<h2 id="simulation">Simulation</h2>
<p>I’ll start by showing you a simulation of the game that you will
create - a simulation that runs here, in this page in your browser.
<strong>Your game will not do that.</strong> My simulation is just to
help you think about all the different pieces that you’ll need to create
and how you will need to make them interact.</p>

<li>Click on Start Game to activate it</li>
<li>Play until you get tired of losing or until you are ready to start
creating this for yourself.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="who-i-am-writing-this-for">Who I am writing this for</h2>
<p>At the school for web development where I work, students have seen
all the code used in this game after only the first 10 days. The
challenge for me was to create an activity for them that would impress
their friends and family after such a short learning period.</p>
<p>Perhaps you haven’t even begun learning JavaScript yet. That’s OK.
I’ll explain how to get started, and how to check, step-by-step, that
you are on the right path.</p>
