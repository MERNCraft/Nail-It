First, you need to set up a Development Environment. You need:

1. A way to run JavaScript or NodeJS scripts on your computer
2. A code editor which will give you plenty of tools for writing JavaScript.

## Install NVM, NodeJS and npm

The most comfortable way to install an application that will run JavaScript files on your computer is to install a program called Node Version Manager, or NVM for short.

Here is an [excellent article on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/) which explains how to do just that.

<summary>Typing commands... where?</summary>
The article above asks you to type commands like `nvm -v`. Perhaps you have a question:

**"*Where exactly* do I type these commands?"**

The answer is: "In a Terminal window".

And the answer to your next question is: "Install Microsoft Virtual Studio Code first, as explained below, and VS Code (as it is called, for short) will provide you with a Terminal window."

As for the answer to your question: **"Why didn't you tell me this *before* you gave the link for installing Node?"**

As you work your way through this guide, you'll see that I have done my best to help troubleshoot any problems that might arise. But if a problem doesn't arise for you, you don't want to be bothered with Too Much Information about what _might_ have gone wrong.

In the future, if you run into difficulties, look a little ahead for an bright orange band with a lifebuoy logo, like the one at the top of this panel. Normally, it will be closed, because I hope that you do not often have problems. That's where you should find troubleshooting suggestions.

## Install Microsoft Virtual Studio Code

Virtual Studio Code (or VS Code, for short) is a free code editor with many powerful tools that are either built-in or are availble as free extensions.

You can follow the [instructions to install VS Code for your operating system](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), and enjoy all the hard work that other developers have contributed to make your experience of writing code so easy.

<summary>A Terminal for installing Node?</summary>
If you need a Terminal for [installing Node](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/), you can use [VS Code's integrated Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics).

Indeed, the game you are going to create will be run from VS Code's integrated Terminal, so you will be spending a lot of time working with it.
