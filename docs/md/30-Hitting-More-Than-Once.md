This challenge is more tricky. I expect that you will see a number of errors as you work on it, so I will walk you through it. Fixing these errors will also resolve the WET issue (We Enjoy Typing - the opposite of DRY).

Here's the display in the Terminal that you are aiming for:

```tex-w
-===========| The nail is 12 units long.

-========| You hit the nail hard.

-======| You hit the nail firmly.

-=====| You hit the nail gently.

-===| You hit the nail firmly.

-| You hit the nail hard.
```
